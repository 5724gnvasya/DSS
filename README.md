# This repository presents a code for [this project](https://github.com/5724gnvasya/Decision-support-system)

## It is the most important part of a project as we are analysing texts here and creating predictions.
### It contains only Python code, which is supposed to create and train a neural network (main.py file). 
### After that, in Training.py file we are testing the trained version
### (which is saved in classifier_bias.pt, classifier_weight.pt and trained_model.pt).
